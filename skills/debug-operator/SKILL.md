# Debug openstack-k8s-operators Operator

This skill provides comprehensive debugging and development workflows for openstack-k8s-operators operators, following openstack-k8s-operators best practices.

## Development Workflow

When debugging or developing an operator, I will:

1. **Development Checks**: Run full development workflow with make targets
2. **Code Quality**: Pre-commit hooks, linting, and syntax validation
3. **Build Verification**: Test compilation and manifest generation
4. **Test Execution**: Run complete test suites or focused tests
5. **Deployment Analysis**: Check running operator pods and resources
6. **Runtime Debugging**: Analyze logs, events, and runtime issues

## Development Commands

### Complete Workflow

- Pre-commit checks, syntax and style validation
- Run `make manifests && make generate`
- Verify operator compilation (`make build`)

### Testing

- Execute `make test`
- Run specific tests with Ginkgo focus
- Generate test coverage reports

### Quality Assurance

- Code style and quality checks (`make golangci`)
- Validate dependencies with `go mod tidy`
- Validate Custom Resource Definitions

## Runtime Debugging

For deployed operators, I will also:

1. **Environment Check**: Verify KUBECONFIG and cluster access
2. **Operator Discovery**: Find operator pods in standard namespaces
3. **Status Analysis**: Check deployment, pod, and replica set status
4. **Log Analysis**: Parse logs for errors, warnings, and patterns
5. **Resource Inspection**: Examine custom resources and their conditions
6. **Event Review**: Check Kubernetes events for issues
7. **RBAC Verification**: Ensure proper permissions are in place

When debugging deployed operators:

```bash
# Debug specific operator
/debug-operator glance-operator openstack-operators

# General cluster debugging
/debug-operator cluster-check
```

## Automated Analysis

I will automatically:

- Detect if we're in an operator development directory
- Run appropriate development workflow based on context
- Search for operators in standard namespaces (openstack, openstack-operators, openstack-k8s-operators)
- Identify error patterns in logs using regex matching
- Check custom resource status and conditions
- Review recent events for warnings and errors
- Verify RBAC configuration

## Usage Examples

### Development Mode

When in an operator directory (with Makefile and go.mod):

```bash
# Run complete development workflow
/debug-operator

# Focus on specific test
/debug-operator focus-test "Checks the Topology"

# Run only tests
/debug-operator test-only
```

## Workflow Detection

I will automatically:

1. **Detect Context**: Check if we're in development or runtime mode
2. **Run Appropriate Workflow**: Development checks vs. runtime debugging
3. **Provide Specific Guidance**: Targeted recommendations based on findings
4. **Create Action Items**: Use TodoWrite for tracking fixes and improvements

## Integration with openstack-k8s-operators Ecosystem

The skill integrates with:

- **openstack-k8s-operators** development practices
- **lib-common** patterns and conventions
- **Ginkgo** testing framework workflows
- **Controller-runtime** debugging patterns

## Log Analysis

This skill includes advanced log pattern matching. When given a log file or oc output, analyze it for:

### Error Patterns

- **API Connectivity**: Connection refused, dial failures
- **RBAC Issues**: Permission denied, forbidden access
- **Resource Problems**: Not found, validation failures
- **Runtime Errors**: Panics, nil pointer exceptions
- **Image Issues**: Pull failures, registry access
- **Webhook Failures**: Admission controller errors

### Performance Patterns

- **Slow Reconciliation**: >30s reconciliation times
- **Queue Issues**: Large queue depths (>100 items)
- **API Latency**: Slow Kubernetes API responses
- **Resource Conflicts**: Optimistic locking failures

### OpenStack-Specific Patterns

- **Service Failures**: Glance, Nova, Cinder, Manila
- **Keystone Auth**: Authentication/authorization issues
- **Database**: Connection and SQL errors
- **Network**: Neutron service problems

### Log Analysis Usage

```bash
# Analyze collected logs
/debug-operator
oc logs deployment/glance-operator -n openstack-operators > nova.log
# Then ask to analyze the log file

# Multi-pod logs
oc logs -l app=operator --all-containers=true > combined.log
```

Output includes: error/warning counts, severity classification, timeline view, and remediation suggestions.

## Common Issues Detected

- Pod crash loops and restart issues
- Image pull failures
- RBAC permission problems
- Custom resource validation errors
- Controller reconciliation failures
- Resource conflicts and dependencies
- Webhook configuration issues

Always start with this skill for any operator debugging to ensure comprehensive analysis.
