# Memory, State, and Worktree Architecture

How the plugin persists context across sessions, tracks active work, isolates parallel execution, and resolves dependencies.

## Architecture

```
~/.openstack-k8s-agents-plans/<operator>/
|
+-- MEMORY.md                            Shared project memory
|     read at start of every /feature and /task-executor session
|     updated after planning and after task completion
|
+-- state.json                           Active work tracking
|     tracks worktrees, active tasks, completed plans
|     enables cross-plan dependency resolution
|
+-- 2026-04-11-OSPRH-2345-plan.md        Plan files
+-- 2026-04-11-OSPRH-6789-plan.md        (one per feature/bug)
+-- decisions/                           Decision records (optional)

+-- .worktrees/                          Git worktrees (gitignored)
      +-- OSPRH-2345/                    One per active plan
      +-- OSPRH-6789/                    Isolated from main branch
```

## MEMORY.md

Shared project memory that persists across sessions. All skills read it at start, update it during work.

### Format

```markdown
# glance-operator Memory

## Active Work
- OSPRH-2345: Adding topology support (Task 2.1 in progress, worktree active)
- OSPRH-6789: Fix nil pointer on missing endpoint (plan complete, not started)

## Discoveries
- lib-common common/topology has TopologyHelper -- use it, don't reimplement
- nova-operator implemented topology in PR #423 -- follow same approach
- EnvTest suite takes ~45s, kuttl not configured

## Decisions
- [2026-04-11] OSPRH-2345: follow nova-operator approach (Strategy A)
- [2026-04-11] OSPRH-2345: TopologyRef as pointer field with omitempty

## Blockers
- (none currently)
```

### Which Skills Use It

| Skill | Reads | Writes |
|-------|-------|--------|
| `/feature` | At start (prior context) | After planning (discoveries, decisions, active work) |
| `/task-executor` | At start (prior context, active work) | After each group + on completion (discoveries, status) |
| `/code-review` | Not currently | Not currently |
| `/jira` | Not currently | Not currently |

### Why It Matters

Without MEMORY.md, each session starts from zero. With it:

- The feature agent doesn't re-discover that lib-common already has a helper
- The task-executor knows what decisions were made during planning
- Parallel instances know what each other is working on
- A resumed session picks up context without re-reading the entire codebase

## state.json

Tracks active work across sessions and instances. Enables dependency resolution and prevents duplicate execution.

### State File Format

```json
{
  "active_tasks": [
    {
      "plan": "2026-04-11-OSPRH-2345-plan.md",
      "task": "2.1",
      "worktree": ".worktrees/OSPRH-2345",
      "branch": "feature/OSPRH-2345",
      "session": "abc123-def456",
      "started": "2026-04-11T10:30:00Z"
    }
  ],
  "completed": [
    {
      "plan": "2026-04-10-OSPRH-1000-plan.md",
      "completed": "2026-04-10T18:00:00Z",
      "commit": "abc1234",
      "session": "xyz789-ghi012"
    }
  ],
  "discoveries": [
    "lib-common common/topology already has TopologyHelper"
  ]
}
```

The `session` field stores `$CLAUDE_SESSION_ID` to identify which Claude Code instance owns a task. This enables conflict detection when multiple instances run concurrently.

## Worktree Isolation

Each plan executes in its own git worktree. This prevents conflicts between parallel instances and keeps the main branch clean.

```
git worktree add -b feature/OSPRH-2345 .worktrees/OSPRH-2345
```

### Parallel Execution

```
Instance 1                          Instance 2
/task-executor OSPRH-2345           /task-executor OSPRH-6789
    |                                   |
    v                                   v
.worktrees/OSPRH-2345               .worktrees/OSPRH-6789
branch: feature/OSPRH-2345         branch: feature/OSPRH-6789
    |                                   |
    | (no file conflicts)               |
    v                                   v
state.json: both registered         state.json: both registered
MEMORY.md: both read/write          MEMORY.md: both read/write
```

### Lifecycle

1. **Create** — `/task-executor` creates worktree before first task
2. **Work** — all file operations happen inside the worktree
3. **Complete** — commit, then ask user: merge now or leave for review?
4. **Cleanup** — on merge: `git worktree remove` + `git branch -d`

## Dependency Resolution

Tasks can declare three types of dependencies:

### Intra-plan

Same plan file. Checked by reading the plan's checkbox state.

```
- [ ] **Task 2.1: Implement reconciliation**
  - **Depends on:** Task 1.1, Task 1.2
```

### Cross-plan

Another plan for the same operator. Checked via state.json and the other plan file.

```
- [ ] **Task 3.1: Update shared CRD types**
  - **Depends on:** OSPRH-6789/Task 1.1
```

### External

A PR in another repository. Checked via `gh pr view`.

```
- [ ] **Task 3.1: Use new TopologyHelper**
  - **External dep:** lib-common PR #789
```

### When Blocked

The task-executor presents options:

```
Task 2.1 is blocked.
  Depends on: Task 1.2 (this plan) -- in progress

Options:
1. Skip to the next unblocked task
2. Proceed anyway (override)
3. Stop and wait
```

## Testing

The test script (`tests/test-memory.sh`) simulates the full task-executor workflow without Claude Code. It creates a temporary environment with a git repo and a dummy plan, then steps through the mechanics as the task-executor agent would: creating MEMORY.md, registering tasks in state.json, setting up worktrees, checking dependencies, checkpointing progress, and pruning memory. No operator code or MCP is needed -- it validates the file operations and state transitions that underpin the memory architecture.

```bash
make test-memory
```

| Phase | Tests | What it validates |
|-------|-------|-------------------|
| MEMORY.md lifecycle | 7 | Create, required sections, update, line count |
| state.json lifecycle | 6 | Create, register task, session ID, duplicate detection, complete, discovery |
| Worktree isolation | 4 | Create, correct branch, isolation from main, cleanup |
| Dependency resolution | 6 | Intra-plan blocked/unblocked, external dep detection, cross-plan format |
| Plan checkpointing | 2 | Checkbox state, next pending task |
| MEMORY.md pruning | 2 | Over-limit detection, pruned under 200 lines |

Test files:

- `tests/test-memory.sh` -- the test script
- `tests/sample-plans/dummy-plan.md` -- dummy plan with dependencies
